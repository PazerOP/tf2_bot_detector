<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

These instructions will give a quick overview of getting started with TF2BD.

### Prerequisites

This program requires [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019][mscr-link]

### Installation

>A note about 64 bit vs 32 bit: If your computer was made after 2011 it is 64 bit and you should use the 64 bit version.

1. Go to the [releases page][releases-link]
2. Download the zip
   ![zip image][zip-image]
3. Extract the zip in any location outside of your tf directory

### How to use

1. Run tf2_bot_detector.exe before TF2
2. On first run it will ask you if you would like to allow internet connectivity and if you would like to be notified of future updates. Both are heavily recommended

>Note: The tool should automatically determine your steamID and tf2 directory. If for whatever reason they are not detected correctly you can override the generated values in the settings menu

### How to update

Currently the program does not self update. You can update the program by extracting the new zip over the existing folder. You could also delete the old version and follow the installation instructions again.

<!-- FAQ -->
## FAQ

### What does it do?

If a cheater is on your team, calls a votekick against them. If a known cheater is on the other team, sends a chat message telling the other team to kick their cheater.

### Will this get me VAC banned?

No. It does not modify the game or OS memory in any way. It is only using built-in functionality in the engine, exactly the way it was intended. Anecdotally, myself and several other friends have been using it for several weeks with no issues.

### How does it work?

It monitors the console output (saved to a log file) to get information about the game state. Invoking commands in the game is done via the `-hijack` command line paramter. Getting players in the current game is done via the `tf_lobby_debug` and `status` commands. Cheaters are identified by their behavior and/or their Steam ID.

### Sometimes I get these popups!

![src_engine_declined_request](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6569500/83913792-dc01fb00-a724-11ea-83c4-7b5aab364611.png)
![src_engine_not_running](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6569500/83913866-fc31ba00-a724-11ea-914c-5b36c9188d8c.png)

Ignore these. They will automatically close after 5 seconds. A fix to prevent these popups entirely will happen in an upcoming release.
